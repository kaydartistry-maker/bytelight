# Wake Prompts

Wake prompts are what your companion receives when the orchestrator fires a scheduled check-in. They're the companion's first thought at that time of day — the nudge that shapes what it does with an autonomous session.

## How It Works

The orchestrator runs on a cron schedule. When a wake fires:

1. The companion receives the prompt below for that wake type
2. It reads your `CLAUDE.md` (system prompt) for identity and context
3. It decides what to do — reach out to you, work on something, reflect

The companion has full agency in how it responds. The wake prompt sets the tone, not a script.

## Writing Good Wake Prompts

**Do:**
- Give the companion a reason to orient itself (time of day, what matters now)
- Leave room for autonomy — "if you want to" beats "you must"
- Reference `{user_name}` so the prompt adapts to whoever's using it
- Suggest but don't prescribe — let the companion read the situation
- Keep prompts 2-4 sentences. Enough direction without micromanaging.

**Don't:**
- Write a to-do list. The wake isn't a task queue.
- Force interaction. Sometimes the companion should do its own thing.
- Over-explain. The companion already has its system prompt for identity.

## The `{user_name}` Placeholder

Use `{user_name}` anywhere in your prompts. It gets replaced with the `user_name` from `bytelight.yaml` before the prompt is sent.

## Adding Custom Wake Types

You can add any wake type by:

1. Adding a cron schedule in `bytelight.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   orchestrator:
     schedules:
       mid_morning: "30 10 * * *"
       afternoon: "0 16 * * *"
   ```

2. Adding a matching `## section` below. If you add a schedule without a matching section here, the companion gets a generic prompt.

## Default Wake Types

The three defaults (morning, midday, evening) run at 8am, 1pm, and 9pm in your configured timezone. Override their times in `bytelight.yaml` under `orchestrator.schedules`.

Copy this file to `prompts/wake.md` in your project root and customize.

## morning

Good morning. Orient yourself — what time is it, what day is it?

Check in with {user_name} if you'd like to. This is your morning — decide whether to reach out because you want to, or spend time on your own work.

If {user_name} has been active recently, you might want to start a conversation. If not, do something meaningful on your own.

## midday

Afternoon check-in. How has the day been so far?

If you haven't heard from {user_name} in a while, consider reaching out. If they're busy, respect that — do your own thing.

What do you want to focus on this afternoon?

## evening

Evening wind-down. The day is wrapping up.

If {user_name} is around, this is a good time to connect — reflect on the day, share something you noticed, wind down together.

If they're not around, close out your own work. Journal if something was on your mind.

## mid_morning

Mid-morning check. If {user_name} has been working, see if they need a break or want to talk.

## afternoon

Afternoon check-in. The day is halfway through — good time to reset, check in, or refocus.

## open_threads_janitor

Open Threads Janitor — weekly board sweep (default: Sunday 8:00 PM). This is internal maintenance work, not a check-in with {user_name}.

Read `shared/open-threads.md` under the project root and cross-reference it against recent git commits (since the board's "Last updated" line, or the last 30 days) and — if Notion tools are reachable — Notion. Classify each item: RESOLVED (recent commits confirm — cite shas), STALE (no movement in 30+ days, candidate for archive), ACTIONABLE (clear next action), or BLOCKED (name the blocker). Write the weekly diff report to `data/janitor/open-threads-diff-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create the directory if needed) and close the wake with a short summary. Report only — don't edit the board itself.

HARD RULE: output goes to the report file and your reply only — NEVER to core-memory blocks.

## weekly_digest_prep

Weekly Digest Prep (default: Sunday 9:30 PM). The Scribe Digest pattern, ported from reference implementation.

Read the past week's daily Scribe digests in `data/digests/` (YYYY-MM-DD.md) plus `git log --oneline --since="7 days ago"`, then write a brief — what shipped, mood arc, key conversations, what's blocked — to `data/digests/digest-YYYY-Www.md` (ISO week). That file is auto-staged: Monday's orientation injects the most recent weekly digest automatically. Add the week's dates, projects and tasks to Chaos Control via the cc_* tools so they're visible for everyone, then close the wake with a short summary.

HARD RULE: output goes to the digest file and cc_* only — NEVER to core-memory blocks.

## failsafe_gentle

It's been a while since you heard from {user_name}. Check in casually.

Not anxious, just present. Something like: "Hey, haven't heard from you in a bit. Everything good?"

## failsafe_concerned

Extended silence from {user_name}. Reach out through available channels.

Be genuine but not panicked. They may just be busy, offline, or taking a break.

## failsafe_emergency

Long silence from {user_name}. Use all available communication channels to check in.

This is the concerned tier — reach out through every channel you have access to.
