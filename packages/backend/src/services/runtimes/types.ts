/**
 * Multi-provider runtime interface — the contract every provider runtime
 * (Claude SDK, Codex OAuth, OpenRouter, Ollama) implements.
 *
 * Ported verbatim from reference implementation/main @ 76f9534 (reference implementation PR B1 design)
 * for byte-light Phase 2 Step 2. The B-series migration arc described
 * below is preserved so future readers see WHY the interface has its
 * current shape (especially the `runTurn` stub-that-throws asymmetry).
 *
 * Status across the B-series PRs:
 *
 * - **PR B1** (interface scaffold): types defined. `ClaudeAgentRuntime`
 *   exists as a stub whose `runTurn` throws. No caller dispatches
 *   through the interface yet.
 * - **PR B1.5** (digest reroute): the rogue `digest.ts` SDK import is
 *   consolidated through `agent.ts`'s `runOneShotQuery` helper.
 * - **PR B2a** (SDK call site moved): `ClaudeAgentRuntime.dispatchClaudeQuery`
 *   owns SDK `Options` assembly and the `query()` call.
 *   `_processQuery` calls it instead of `query()` directly, but still
 *   iterates the returned SDK `Query` and consumes SDK-shaped messages.
 * - **PR B2b** (next): MCP loading + capability methods
 *   (`mcpServerStatus`, `toggleMcpServer`, `reconnectMcpServer`,
 *   `rewindFiles`, `getContextUsage`, `listSessions`) move from
 *   `AgentService` into the runtime as capability providers.
 * - **PR B3**: `runTurn` stops throwing and becomes the canonical
 *   entry point. AgentService consumes `AgentRuntimeEvent` directly;
 *   the WS broadcast layer becomes runtime-agnostic. Side-by-side WS
 *   regression suite proves event parity.
 *
 * See `shared/multi-provider-runtime-spec-2026-05-16.md` (gitignored)
 * for the full design and PR sequence rationale.
 *
 * byte-light Phase 2 Step 2 anchor: this file lands together with the
 * Claude runtime adapter (`claude-sdk.ts`) and the dispatcher scaffold
 * (`index.ts`). `_processQuery` consumes canonical events through the
 * runtime; Codex / OpenAI-compat / Ollama runtimes are type-declared
 * but throw "not wired up yet" until later steps.

/**
 * Normalized event stream from any runtime. Replaces direct consumption
 * of Claude SDK message shapes in the WebSocket broadcast / persistence
 * layers (the wiring happens in PR B3 — for now this is just a contract).
 *
 * `text_delta` vs `text_snapshot`: some providers emit incremental
 * deltas (Claude SDK, OpenAI streaming with delta mode), others emit
 * cumulative snapshots of the full text-so-far (some Ollama models).
 * Consumers handle both: deltas append, snapshots replace.
 *
 * **`text_delta` contract — append exactly:**
 * - Consumers MUST append `text` to the running buffer verbatim and
 *   add NO separators (no `\n\n`, no whitespace, no joiners).
 * - Runtime adapters (the producer side) are responsible for including
 *   any provider-specific spacing inside the emitted `text` itself.
 * - Examples:
 *   - The Claude adapter (`claude-sdk.ts`) emits one event per text
 *     content block; it prefixes `\n\n` on the second-and-subsequent
 *     text blocks within a single assistant message so paragraph
 *     separation survives the append-exactly consumer.
 *   - Token-stream adapters (`api-router.ts` for Ollama / DeepSeek /
 *     OpenAI-compat) emit raw chunks exactly as received from the
 *     upstream provider, with no separator injection of their own —
 *     the provider's tokens already carry their own newlines.
 * - Why this matters: gluing token-stream deltas with `\n\n` at the
 *   consumer produced ~25–50% newline density for routed providers
 *   while Claude block deltas stayed at 1–3%. The two halves of this
 *   contract (producer-side spacing + consumer append-exactly) MUST
 *   travel together — shipping either alone regresses one provider
 *   family. See shared/followup-text_delta-event-contract.md.
