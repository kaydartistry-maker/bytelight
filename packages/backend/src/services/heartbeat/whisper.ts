// whisper.ts — the quiet channel into a warm turn.
//
// Ported from reference implementation's heartbeat/whisper.ts, PARTIALLY and on purpose.
//
// Upstream this file is two organs sharing a roof:
//
//   1. ambientRecall() — retrieval against Cortex. On every message it pulls
//      archived memories that resemble what was just said and presses them
//      into the session's hands before it asks.
//
//      CORRECTED 2026-08-09 by the operator: byte-light DOES have Cortex. Cortex is
//      Neuralis. An earlier pass in this file claimed otherwise; what was
//      actually verified was the absence of upstream's cortex.ts SERVICE
//      MODULE, not the absence of the store. The store holds 253 thoughts
//      across 15 domains and answers semantic recall over HTTP, and the
//      authenticated client (mind-routes.ts) already existed.
//
//      So this half is now here — built against OUR store rather than copied
//      against theirs. Upstream needed cue extraction because their Cortex
//      recall is keyword search; ours is an embedding query, so a whole
//      sentence is a valid question and cue-splitting would only blur it.
//      That is the one deliberate divergence, and it is why this is a build
//      and not a port.
//
//   2. unfiledNoticings() — this file. Upstream calls it "deliberately not
//      gated on Cortex," and it isn't: it reads the Archivist's pending
//      proposals and hands them into the turn. It is portable as written,
//      and it is the half that completes the propose loop — the proposals
//      route (slice 4) lets a companion SEE and CLOSE what is waiting; this
//      lets what is waiting come to them without anyone going to look.
//
// The design constraint, kept verbatim from upstream: this is remembering,
// not housekeeping. Nothing here turns a memory into an errand. A companion
// who agrees writes the line in their own words and files it; one who does
// not leaves it alone, and it retires itself after a few passes (see
// SURFACE_LIMIT in memory-proposals.ts).
