/**
 * Rooms — companion registry reads + per-thread roster read/write.
 *
 * Backs routes/rooms-routes.ts. Schema lives in migrations/014_companions.sql
 * (companions + thread_companions) and is seeded/backfilled by
 * migrations/015_rooms_seed.sql. Nothing in dispatch/prompt assembly reads
 * these yet (that is Slice 4) — this is the plumbing that lets the picker
 * (Slice 3) read and write a thread's roster.
 *
 * Schema shape ported from NESTstack's rooms-worker (cindiekinzz-coder, MIT):
 * a room's participant list = the set of companion ids seated in it. byte-light
 * stores that as thread_companions rows joined back to the companions registry.
 *
 * Style matches byte-light's flat-service pattern (services/db.ts,
 * services/db/companion-settings.ts): prepared statements per call
 * (better-sqlite3 caches them), plain row → typed object casts at the boundary.
 * The roster write runs in a transaction (delete-then-insert) so a thread's
 * roster is never observed half-swapped.
