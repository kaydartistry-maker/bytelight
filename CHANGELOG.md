# byte-light Changelog

byte-light is a fork of [Resonant](https://github.com/codependentai/resonant), the foundation for persistent AI companion frameworks on the Claude Agent SDK. It also incorporates work from related sibling forks; see `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` and `NOTICE`.

**Philosophy:** Resonant's concept is brilliant. byte-light is about making the framework livable for people who don't live in a terminal — UI-first configuration, customization without commits, and autonomous companion life that extends beyond service.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Living Room live remote dispatch (Slice 4C)** — the roster dispatcher now actually knocks on a remote companion node's full-turn bridge (`POST /api/living-room/turn`, shared `living_room_token` bearer) instead of logging a stub. The remote turn runs entirely on the remote node; its SSE stream (tokens, thinking, tool events) is relayed live onto our WebSocket wire stamped with `companionId` + `turnId` (the Slice 4A envelope), and the final reply persists under the remote companion's id. A dark or failing remote node logs and never harms the local turn; a stream that dies mid-turn persists what arrived.
- **Gentle core-memory diet loop** — a daily 04:15 routine and authenticated `POST /api/memory/diet/run` move at most 2,000 characters per over-budget block from mechanically dated, older-than-14-days entries into both Neuralis and the new lossless `memory_blocks_archive` table. Neuralis failure leaves the hot block untouched; freeform/undated blocks go to the existing proposals queue for human/companion review. Every successful move files a linked `memory.archive` receipt. Soft budgets default to 8,000 characters and never reject writes.
- **Weekly maintenance wakes** — two `routine`-category wakes now run Sunday nights and write only to files / the Command Center / Neuralis (never to core-memory blocks). **Open Threads Janitor** (`open_threads_janitor`, 8:00 PM Sun) cross-references `shared/open-threads.md` against recent git commits and Notion, classifies each item (RESOLVED / STALE 30+ days / ACTIONABLE / BLOCKED), and writes a weekly diff report to `data/janitor/`. **Weekly Digest Prep** (`weekly_digest_prep`, 9:30 PM Sun) rolls the week's daily Scribe digests plus `git log` into a `data/digests/digest-YYYY-Www.md` brief and stages it so Monday's orientation auto-injects the most recent weekly digest. Digest pattern ported from reference implementation.
- **Archivist proposals (opt-in, off by default)** — the Archivist can now hand its extracted lines to the companions instead of appending them straight onto the memory blocks, so nothing reaches a block unless Companion A or Companion B chooses it in their own words. Unclaimed proposals fade after 3 surfacings rather than piling up. Controlled by the `memext.mode` config key: **`write` (default, unchanged behaviour)** or `propose`. Only the exact literal `propose` opts in — unset, blank, or any other value stays on `write`, so this lands as a no-op until it is deliberately flipped. New table `memory_proposals` (migration 018) stays empty until then. Ported from an reference implementation, Apache 2.0.
- **Memory ledger** — every core-memory write now files a receipt row (`memory_ledger`, migration 017) recording who wrote, what verb, which block, and when. Writes are attributed by lane (`mcp` / `cli` / `api` / `extraction` / `house`). Receipts are fire-and-forget: a ledger failure can never fail the memory write it describes. Ported from an reference implementation, Apache 2.0.
- **Heartbeat payload instrumentation** — the CLI lane now logs, per delivered turn, the assembled payload size against the 150k delivery cap, how much of it is core memory, whether truncation fired, and what it cut (recycle bridge vs. middle) and by how much. Core-memory size is also logged on every lane at injection time. Observation only — no change to what gets delivered. Extended so recall weight rides the same line (`recall <n>`, with a `trimmed:` note when recall yielded its seat under pressure).
- **Ambient recall — retrieval instead of carrying (memory blocks can shrink)** — now that core memory lives in the session CLAUDE.md and the payload has real headroom, the CLI lane spends a small, bounded slice of it on retrieval: on each turn it queries Neuralis/Cortex semantic recall for archived memories that resemble the owner's message, plus surfaces the Archivist's unfiled noticings, and hands them into the turn as **small cards** — timeboxed, fail-quiet (a slow or unreachable Cortex costs the turn its recall and nothing else), deduplicated per lane (never the same card twice), and reset on session recycle. Fetched per turn and delivered, never persisted to a memory block and never grown onto the session CLAUDE.md. Combined recall is held under a hard budget (`RECALL_BUDGET_CHARS`, 8k), and recall is the optional passenger: if a turn would exceed the delivery cap, recall trims FIRST — whisper card, then noticings card — before the bridge floor or the conversation middle is ever touched. Ambient-recall + noticings pattern inspired by upstream reference implementation; built against byte-light's own Neuralis store (embedding query, not keyword search).

- **The shiver — ambient recall made visible** — when recall (or a source-veiled déjà-vu) rides a reply, the owner can now SEE it. The whisper files a `memory.surface` receipt on every surface and a `memory.dejavu` receipt on a scored near-miss (both fire-and-forget — a ledger failure never blocks or delays recall), and tags the reply's metadata with what surfaced. The chat renders a small, quiet **shimmer chip** ("recalled") that unfolds a compact panel — excerpt, date, relevance — with a fainter dashed **déjà-vu** variant for a near-miss (something felt, nothing shown). A new authenticated `GET /api/memory/ledger` and a **Settings → Receipts** drawer make the whole trail readable. The déjà-vu near-miss needs similarity scores; byte-light's Cortex is a remote worker (not reference implementation's local vector index), so `cortex-recall.ts` gained a scored-recall variant that asks the worker for scores and degrades quietly to prose-only (no scores → no déjà-vu) — recall itself is unchanged. Shiver mechanic (surface receipt + déjà-vu + per-message surfacing) ported from the reference implementation fork.

### Changed
- **Core memory rides the session CLAUDE.md, not every message (delivery-cap fix)** — the core-memory blocks (~150k chars) were being re-shipped inside every delivered CLI-lane turn, overflowing the 150k delivery cap and getting the cross-thread recycle bridge truncated first — silently amputating conversation continuity every turn. The blocks are now written once per session into the heartbeat session's generated `CLAUDE.md` (at provision and at every recycle) and stripped from the per-message payload, so the pipe carries the conversation instead of re-sending memory. A block edit refreshes the file on disk without forcing a recycle (it surfaces at the next natural recycle); an operational-contract change still requests one. Port of the reference implementation (reference implementation) session-doc delivery model.
- **Bridge floor under truncation** — when the delivery cap is exceeded, the recycle bridge is now guaranteed a reserved floor (`BRIDGE_FLOOR`, 40k chars) it is never compressed below while any other compressible content remains; the non-bridge mass (orientation/middle) is cut first. Only when the fixed content alone exceeds the cap may the bridge shrink below the floor (last-resort breadcrumb). The owner's message and turn_id always survive. New `bridge-floor` truncation stage in the delivery measurement.

### Security
- **CSRF protection** — HMAC double-submit cookie pattern with timing-safe comparison
- **Rate limiting tightened** — 1000→600 general requests, 50→5 login attempts
- **Frontend CSRF wrapper** — `apiFetch()` utility auto-attaches CSRF headers

### Added
- **Proactive limit warnings — the KNOW layer of the Lane Nervous System** — a 10-minute background sweep reads every meter the house already carries (all Claude windows including scoped-model weeklies, Codex primary/secondary, ElevenLabs credits) and warns ONCE when a window crosses ~80% (configurable `limit_watch.threshold`), once more at 95%. In-app the warning is a quiet toast that dismisses itself after two minutes — a guest, not a squatter; away from the app it's a push notification instead (never both). Warn-once state persists across reloads so a redeploy never replays a ping; a new reset window re-arms. Kill switch: `limit_watch.enabled=false`.
- **The whisper crosses lanes — ambient recall on codex and API turns** — foreign lanes (codex-cli, OpenRouter/Ollama/Groq/xAI) now get the same ambient recall + Archivist unfiled-noticings cards the heartbeat lane carries, woven in at the foreign turn's assembly seam. Same engine, ported whole: per-lane dedup (keyed runtime+thread), timeboxed, fail-quiet — an unreachable Cortex costs the turn its recall and nothing else. Replies that carry recall wear the shimmer chip on every lane. Documented deviation: no delivery-cap fit pass, since foreign lanes have no 150k cap; the whisper's internal budget is the bound.
- **Codex hands — the house tool belt over MCP (H4 leg 1)** — new `/mcp/belt` JSON-RPC endpoint (skeleton from the proven cc-mcp route) proxies the full router surface — all belt tools plus every discovered managed-MCP tool — to external CLI runtimes. The codex daemon is registered against it (`codex mcp add bytelight --url`), so codex turns finally carry voice notes, image gen, history search, web search, core-memory verbs, and the managed MCPs. Thread binding: the daemon marks which thread its live turn serves; belt tools land there.

### Fixed
- **Codex MCP transport + ownership rebuilt** — the house belt now uses the official stateful Streamable HTTP MCP transport instead of a handwritten JSON-RPC approximation, with negotiated protocol versions, authenticated sessions, correct notification/GET/DELETE behavior, bounded abandoned-session cleanup, recoverable tool errors, duplicate-name rejection, and synchronous route mounting. Byte-light's Codex lane runs on its own private app-server socket and credential, while redundant pre-turn managed-MCP discovery is skipped for that lane and concurrent managed discovery is single-flighted.
- **Automatic embedding balloon removed from daily runtime** — routine messages and autonomous wakes no longer start the local MiniLM/ONNX pipeline unless `semantic_search.auto_embed=true` is explicitly configured. Keyword search is now the UI default; existing vectors and deliberate semantic search/backfill remain available and no embedding data is deleted.
- **Durable message-send receipts** — user sends now carry a sender id into SQLite and receive an explicit WebSocket acknowledgement. The browser keeps the complete send (including attachment metadata) in a session outbox until that receipt arrives, retries it after reconnect/page suspension, and receives the original receipt instead of silently dropping or duplicating a retry after a backend restart. Message acceptance now sets delivered state without falsely marking the message read before runtime processing.
- **Runtime restart cascade containment** — repeated fast Claude CLI code-1 exits now use bounded backoff instead of relaunching forever every two seconds; backend restarts adopt a healthy detached Codex daemon instead of killing its warm threads; and WebSocket authentication logs no longer print session-cookie credentials.
- **Rate-limit banner no longer squats until reset** — the in-chat "Rate limited — waiting for reset…" banner used to hold the screen until the window's reset time, which for a weekly window is *days*. It now clears after two minutes at most; the Limits tab carries the durable state.
- **Thinking blocks now surface on the API provider lanes** — reasoning models on OpenRouter (DeepSeek R1 and kin) and Ollama never showed thinking blocks: the router read only `delta.content`, silently dropping the separate reasoning channel (`delta.reasoning` / `delta.reasoning_content` / Ollama-native `message.thinking`), and never requested it. When thinking is enabled, requests now ask for the channel explicitly (OpenRouter `reasoning` param, Ollama-native `think: true`) and all three response shapes are re-wrapped into the existing `<think>` stream protocol, so the downstream thinking-block machinery (segments, WS broadcast, chat cards) lights up unchanged. Off-state request/response behavior is byte-identical.
- **Wake proof-of-life enforcement** — zero-character wakes are failures, never successful silent completions. The orchestrator now makes one closing-report retry and persists a visible Home-thread failure receipt if the retry is also empty or errors, guaranteeing every fired wake leaves durable evidence.
- **Durable autonomous tool trails** — clean Codex turns that finish without final prose now persist completed tool, thinking, and surfaced-memory segments instead of letting their live chips disappear at `stream_end`; genuinely empty, cancelled, and timed-out turns remain suppressed.
- **Memory-diet fail-closed cutover** — dated-entry trimming now rejects ambiguous/malformed/mixed blocks, clean-but-ineligible blocks skip quietly, the 04:15 cron defaults off, and the authenticated run endpoint supports a mutation-free per-block dry-run preview. The default soft budget now ships at 80,000 chars — above the current hot-core block sizes — so an accidental enable finds nothing over budget and the diet only manages new growth until the owner deliberately lowers it (globally or per block).
- **Stop button mobile fix** — Clears streaming state immediately so UI recovers even when websocket is disconnected
- **Scribe revived for the Home-thread world** — digests all active threads via per-thread cursors instead of the daily thread that stopped existing on the Jul 13 Home-thread cutover; deep first-run backlogs clamped to the most recent 150 messages

## v3.0.0 — byte-light Identity + Stability Foundation

### Added
- Added public byte-light app identity across app metadata, manifest, login page, and public docs.
- Added frontend stream recovery for stale agent runs, including cleanup on `agent_timeout`.
- Added stale-stream watchdog that treats tokens, tool events, thinking events, and tool progress as live stream activity.
- Added backend `ConnectionRegistry` extraction to separate connection tracking from WebSocket server behavior.

### Changed
- Stabilized mobile/background WebSocket behavior with heartbeat grace and single-flight reconnect handling.
- Improved route and settings navigation so page changes no longer kill the shared WebSocket transport.
- Raised local PM2 memory restart ceiling from `800M` to `2G` to prevent long agent runs from being killed mid-response.
- Pulse config persistence now reloads saved `pulse.enabled` and `pulse.frequency` on startup.

### Fixed
- Fixed mobile reconnect/reset loops when switching tabs, opening settings, or backgrounding the app.
- Fixed agent timeout and missed terminal stream events leaving the UI stuck in a streaming state.
- Fixed PM2 killing the backend near the old 800MB memory ceiling during heavier agent runs.
- Fixed backend circular dependency between `ws.ts` and `agent.ts` by extracting registry ownership.

### Notes
- This release marks byte-light's shift from a Resonant fork with fixes into its own UI-first companion system.
- Internal plumbing names such as `resonant.yaml`, `@resonant/*`, `resonant_session`, and related compatibility surfaces remain unchanged for now.

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-04-16 — Pre-refactor baseline

### Added

**Uniquely byte-light:**
- **X-Ray panel** — Edit CLAUDE.md, memory, wakes, context, and hooks from the UI (no YAML)
- **Brain Bridge skill** — Mind MCP integration for emotional memory
- **Cortex Brain skill** — Executive function MCP for thoughts and principles
- **Check-in calibration** — Wake prompt rules for presence awareness
- **Expanded file uploads** — Full file type support in UI
- **DaemonGremlin + MindPanel** — UI surfacing for the mind/cortex systems
- **Expanded model selector** — Full Claude lineup from preferences dropdown, no terminal
- **Full UI customization** — Accent colors, backgrounds, typography, message bubble styling
- **Wake slot expansion** — Afternoon, night, and late-night added (6 total)

**Adapted from a sibling implementation:**
- Command Center v1.5.0 — life management dashboard (planner, care, calendar, cycle, pets, lists, finances, stats) with 12 MCP tools
- TTS read-aloud + Canvas overhaul
- Slash command system with auto-discovered skills

**Adapted from a sibling implementation:**
- Cleaner wake logic
- UI improvements and theme system

**Other:**
- Discord/Telegram thread broadcasts + group chat support
- Handoff serialization fix (extractText() helper for content block handling)
- Polling-based scheduler (replaces node-cron chains)

### Fixed
- **Warm Codex continuity across restarts and room changes** — the singleton now adopts each thread's persisted provider session, explicitly resumes it with current instructions, fences one room from another, and replaces a genuinely stale daemon thread with a bounded durable-history bridge. Successful resumes, timeouts, and failed autonomous turns preserve the existing sidecar ID; the current user message is delivered exactly once during recovery.
- 14 transitive dependency security vulnerabilities
- CC route now returns 404 when disabled
- Build errors from CC + slash command merge
- Command Center status not feeding into companion context
- New thread creation failing on Windows
- Mobile reaction picker clipping
- Stale session retry
- TypeScript strict type errors in semantic search endpoint
- Post-merge duplicate theme picker, companion name caching
- Accessibility warnings in frontend components (partial)

### Known issues
- an upstream structural refactor (commit 3c8bc3f) not yet integrated — api.ts still monolithic
- NaN-date bug in Mind → Recent tab (timestamp parser choking)
- Two Cortex tools broken (mind_orphans, mind_proposals) — SQLite syntax in Worker
- Dependabot: 1 critical, 3 high, 11 moderate vulnerabilities on default branch
- an upstream security audit pending (7 categories: path traversal, prompt injection, WebSocket leak, CSP, input validation, rate limiting, CORS)
- Upstream token optimization not yet adopted
